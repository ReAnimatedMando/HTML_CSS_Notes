# HTML & CSS Notes

Much like a newspaper/word document, a web page is designed with headings, content, sub-headings, and more content to help direct the reader. **HTML** describes the structure of pages, and **CSS** styles that page. 

## HTML 

*    Elements of HTML live in angled brackets.
*    Elements are usually made up of two tags, an opening tag, and a closing tag. Notice the forward slash in the closing tag.
*    Basic elements and their meaning. HTML tags, anything between the open and close are part of the html. Body elements, anything between opening and closing should be shown inside the main browser window. h1 elements; words between are the main heading. p elements words between are a paragraph. h2 elements; words between are a sub-heading. 
*    Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. 
*    Attributes provide additional info about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and consist of a Name and a Value separated by =. p lang=”en-us”, Here the attribute lang is language and en-us specifies English-United States. Majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements. 
*    Before a body element (one shown within the web browser), you will often see a head element. This is info about the page (also known as meta data), often a title. head, title. - - Anything written between the title tags will appear in the title bar at the top of the browser window.
