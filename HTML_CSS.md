# HTML & CSS Notes

Much like a newspaper/word document, a web page is designed with headings, content, sub-headings, and more content to help direct the reader. **HTML** describes the structure of pages, and **CSS** styles that page. 

## HTML 

*    Elements of HTML live in angled brackets. <html>
*    Elements are usually made up of two tags, an opening <tag>, and a closing </tag>. Notice the forward slash in the closing tag.
*    Basic elements and their meaning. <Html> tags, anything between the open and close are part of the html. <body>, anything between opening and closing should be shown inside the main browser window. <h1> words between are the main heading. <p> words between are a paragraph. <h2> words between are a sub-heading. 
*    Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. 
*    Attributes provide additional info about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and consist of a Name and a Value separated by =. <p lang=”en-us”> Here the attribute lang is language and en-us specifies English-United States. Majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements. 
*    Before a body element (one shown within the web browser), you will often see a <head> element. This is info about the page, often a title. <head> <title>. - - Anything written between the <title> tags will appear in the title bar at the top of the browser window.
